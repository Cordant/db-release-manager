# Bertrand Application Manager - bam

Because it's cool


## New installation 
```

```
## How does it work

I don't quite know, it's like magic, but enhanced

## How do I make it work

Ok, that's a relevant question.

Please check out the [documentation](docs)

## Tags

The application uses tags defined on the database tables to create the files on all layers. Please refer to the list of tags below to know what tags can be used.

Example with ignore tag

```sql
/* #ignore */
create table dumt_version_ver (
    pk_ver_id serial primary key,
    ver_name text UNIQUE not null,
    ver_content json null
);
```

### Fields Tags

- `#sort` --sorts on this column
- `#list-filter=<name?>` --generates the list code with a filter on this column
- `#camel-cased-name=<name!>` --sets the camel cased name
- `#get-with-parent` --mark the current object as to get when getting the parent object
- `#ignore-for-fk-check` --mark the current field to be ignore when checking for foreign keys

### Table Tags

actions: save (deals with update and insert), delete, get, list

- `#ignore` --ignores this entity for file generation
- `#roles=['<role 1>', '<role 2>']` --roles that can access this resource, overwritten by the action specific tags below
- `#<action!>-roles=['<role 1>', '<role 2>']` --sets the roles for the specific action
- `#no-<action!>` --ignores the generation of the file for the specified action
- `#service-name=<service name>` -- name of the service that will be used for the serverless function
